# Product Requirements Document: Brewery Inventory Management System (SaaS)

## Introduction

The Brewery Inventory Management System is a comprehensive SaaS (Software as a Service) solution designed to help craft breweries of all sizes track and manage their inventory from raw materials to finished products. This cloud-based system will streamline the brewing process, reduce waste, optimize stock levels, and provide valuable insights into production efficiency. As a multi-tenant SaaS platform, it offers scalability, regular updates, and subscription-based pricing to meet the needs of growing breweries without requiring significant upfront investment in IT infrastructure.

## Goals

1. Reduce inventory-related profit losses from 22% to less than 10% within six months of implementation
2. Decrease stockouts of critical raw materials by at least 90%
3. Improve inventory accuracy to 98% or higher
4. Reduce time spent on manual inventory counts by 75%
5. Provide real-time visibility into all stages of the brewing process
6. Enable data-driven decision making through comprehensive reporting and analytics
7. Achieve a customer acquisition rate of 10 new brewery clients per month after launch
8. Maintain a customer retention rate of at least 90% annually
9. Establish a scalable SaaS infrastructure capable of supporting 1000+ brewery clients
10. Generate recurring subscription revenue with a target of $500,000 ARR within the first year

## Open Questions

1. Should the system include a forecasting component to predict future inventory needs based on production schedules and historical data?
2. What level of granularity is needed for tracking ingredients (e.g., tracking individual hop varieties vs. general hop inventory)?
3. How should the system handle partial use of packaged products (e.g., a keg that is partially emptied for samples)?
4. What specific integrations might be needed in future versions?
5. What are the regulatory compliance requirements for batch tracking and reporting in the target market?
6. How should the system handle seasonal or limited-edition brews versus regular production?
